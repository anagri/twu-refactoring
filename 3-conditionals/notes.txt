Observation :
Nested If-else-case
Duplicated logic
Position not used to represent inside rover

Smell - Complicated conditional logic for navigation
Solution - Extract methods and move it to position, create enum Direction and use state pattern to simplify and distribute calculation

Can try :
Ask to implement solution without using enums, Java 1.4 typesafe object way

+ Immutable position object
+ Using state pattern
+ Using enums
+ Using equals and hashCode
+ State and Strategy are if-killers
